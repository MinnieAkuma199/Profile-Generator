Get prompt to loop until user says they dont want anymore options so maybe a boolean value paired with an if statement 

I want prompts to ask certain questions depending if engineer, manager, or intern is selected

I want my html to append correctly to actually build the webpage once user puts in input

What is the point of the classes, how will they be used here?

** Need to start building tests! **
for employee: 
testing for class Employee
it('Does it create an object')
keys:name, id, email 
Does it set the keys 
test for the methods and thats it

--New JS for every class created--
1st class is Employee as the parent class:
name
id
email

getName()
getId()
getEmail()
getRole()—returns 'Employee'

2nd class is Manager:
name
id
email
**officeNumber

getOfficeNumber() --> not sure if i need this but added it in
getName()
getId()
getEmail()
**getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'

3rd class is Engineer:
name
id
email
**github—GitHub username

getName()
getId()
getEmail()
**getGithub()
**getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'

4th class is Intern:
name
id
email
**school

getName()
getId()
getEmail()
**getSchool()
**getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'
