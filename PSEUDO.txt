For ReadMe: My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I wrote a test for every part of my code and ensured it all passed.
I used the Jest library to run the tests created. I used the Inquirer library to collect input from the user and display the profiles according to the input. 
Jest and Inquirer are involed by using the following command: 
node index.js
