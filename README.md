## Description

My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each employee input. I wrote a test for the constructor classes created to ensure they were passing in the values I wanted correctly.

I learned how to use Jest to write tests and specifically continued working with command line interfaces. The video linked under [Usage](#usage) demonstrates functionality and passing of all tests created.
