## Description

-My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I wrote a test for every part of my code and ensured it all passed.

-I learned how to use Jest to write tests and specifically worked with command line interfaces more.
